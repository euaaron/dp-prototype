# dp-prototype
Academic project about Prototype Pattern

Basically it is a Fibonacci list generator with a random Bug functionality that throws random (pre-programmed) errors, breaking the system on purpose.
There is one Bug while all others are it's clone.

Also, there's a small chance of getting the desired fibonacci list. 

To try out manualy, go to `pom.xml` and change `<env.PROD>false</env.PROD>` to `true`, so you can test it manually, then run the test.

Or just change the numbers inside the JUnit test file.
